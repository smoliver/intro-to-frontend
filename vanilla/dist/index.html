        <h2>JS vs C</h2>
        <p>
          The central difference between Javascript and C based langues is that JS is interpreted rather than compiled. As a result JS variable types are determined at run time and functions can be treated like any other object.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because functions are "first class objects," the scope of the <i>this</i> keyword varries widely depending on mode and syntax, and is more complicated to anticipate
        </p>
        <p>
          A final difference is truthiness.  Because javascript isn't compiled to binary, truthiness in the language is a little more arbitrary and illogical
        </p>

        <h2>Variables</h2>
        <p>There are three ways declare a variable in javascript.  All three can be used for any variable type.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <h3><a href="https://goo.gl/EQFfp9" target="_blank">var</a></h3>
            <p>The most basic form of variable declaration. Fully backwards compatable. Global or function scope</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3><a href="https://goo.gl/cRfCme" target="_blank">let</a></h3>
            <p>Introduced in ECMAScript 2015 (<i>ES 2015</i>). Block scope, similar to C++ variables</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3><a href="https://goo.gl/7YR1W9" target="_blank">const</a></h3>
            <p>Introduced in ES 2015, similar to <i>let</i> but cannot be reasigned</p>
          </li>
        </ol>
